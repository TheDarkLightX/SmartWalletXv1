# AI Audit Guide for SecureWallet

This document provides instructions for submitting the SecureWallet codebase to AI tools for external security and code quality audits.

## ChatGPT (GPT-4o) Audit Process

### Option 1: File-by-File Review (Detailed)

1. **Sign in to ChatGPT** with a Plus subscription (for GPT-4o access)
2. **Start a new conversation** with GPT-4o model
3. **Provide context**: Begin with an overview of the project
   ```
   I'd like you to audit a security-focused smart contract wallet that leverages multi-party computation, zero-knowledge proofs, and AI-driven security protocols. The wallet is built for Pulsechain with Ethereum support.
   ```
4. **Upload files for review**: Click the paperclip icon and upload one file at a time
   - Upload in logical order (schema → storage → auth → core components → UI)
   - Important files to prioritize:
     - `shared/schema.ts`
     - `client/src/lib/tokenomics.ts`
     - `client/src/lib/ethers.ts`
     - `client/src/lib/secure-environment.ts`
     - `client/src/lib/hardware-wallets.ts`
     - `client/src/lib/passwordless-auth.ts`
     - `client/src/lib/secure-mpc.ts`
     - `client/src/lib/zk-proofs.ts`
     - `security-audit-report.md`

5. **Ask specific questions**:
   - "Are there any security vulnerabilities in this implementation?"
   - "Does the tokenomics implementation correctly handle the 25/75 split?"
   - "Is the multi-party computation implementation secure?"
   - "Are there any issues with the zero-knowledge proof implementation?"
   - "What improvements would you recommend for the passwordless authentication?"

### Option 2: Bulk Analysis (Overview)

1. **Sign in to ChatGPT Plus**
2. **Enable Advanced Data Analysis** (Code Interpreter)
3. **Create a ZIP file** of the codebase with:
   ```bash
   zip -r securewallet.zip * -x "node_modules/*" -x ".git/*" -x "dist/*"
   ```
4. **Upload the ZIP file** and ask for a comprehensive audit:
   ```
   I've uploaded a ZIP file of a secure wallet application. Please:
   1. Extract and analyze the codebase
   2. Identify security vulnerabilities
   3. Evaluate code quality and architecture
   4. Assess cryptographic implementations
   5. Provide recommendations for improvement
   ```

## Gemini Audit Process

1. **Sign in to Gemini Advanced**
2. **Start a new conversation**
3. **Upload files**:
   - Gemini can handle multiple file uploads simultaneously
   - Group related files together (e.g., all tokenomics files)
   - Specify that you want a security audit:
   ```
   Please audit these files from my secure wallet application for security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and potential improvements.
   ```
4. **Ask for comparison**:
   - If you've already received feedback from ChatGPT, you can ask Gemini to compare findings
   ```
   Another AI model identified the following issues... Do you agree with these findings? What additional issues do you see?
   ```

## Claude Audit Process

1. **Sign in to Anthropic Claude 3 Opus**
2. **Start a new conversation**
3. **Upload files** by dragging them into the interface
4. **Prompt for security audit**:
   ```
   I'm developing a secure wallet application for cryptocurrency and would like you to perform a security audit on these files. Please identify:
   1. Security vulnerabilities
   2. Cryptographic implementation issues
   3. Potential attack vectors
   4. Privacy concerns
   5. Code quality issues
   Please be thorough and specific, providing code examples for any recommended fixes.
   ```

## Comparing AI Audit Results

After collecting audits from multiple AI models, create a comparison matrix:

1. **Create a spreadsheet** with the following columns:
   - Issue Category
   - Issue Description
   - ChatGPT Finding
   - Gemini Finding
   - Claude Finding
   - Priority (High/Medium/Low)
   - Resolution Plan

2. **Look for consensus** - If multiple AI tools identify the same issue, prioritize it

3. **Address unique findings** - Some AI tools may catch issues others miss

4. **Consider model strengths**:
   - GPT-4o is often strong on general code quality and patterns
   - Gemini may excel at specific vulnerability detection
   - Claude may provide more detailed explanations

## Regular Audit Schedule

To maintain security, establish a regular AI audit schedule:

1. **Pre-Release Audit**: Complete full audit before launch
2. **Quarterly Full Audits**: Comprehensive review every 3 months
3. **Feature-Specific Audits**: Audit new code before merging
4. **Dependency Update Audits**: Audit after major dependency changes

Remember that AI audits are a supplement to, not a replacement for, professional security audits by specialized firms for production deployments.
